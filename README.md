# Modeling U.S. County-level Cancer Mortality Rates: an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Linear Regression Model

In this study, I create an ordinary least-squares (OLS) linear regression model for U.S. county-level cancer mortality rates based on county-level socioeconomic parameters.

I perform EDA on a selection of predictors, fit an initial model, and then use variable selection methods to pare down the model. I also evaluate OLS assumptions and check for influential points and outliers. Finally, I give some example predictions and examine predictor importances before presenting the final model summary.
